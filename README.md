# **Interview Preparation - Algorithms - Holberton School**

## **Introduction**

This repository contains several projects developed as part of the _Interview Preparation - Algorithms_ curriculum at Holberton School, undertaken alongside a Full-Stack development track. The primary goal of these projects is to enhance skills in algorithmic problem solving, preparing for technical interviews and industry challenges.

Each project focuses on fundamental algorithm concepts, ranging from data manipulation (such as arrays and grids) to the management of more complex structures. These projects aim to test and improve logical reasoning and performance optimization skills using programming languages such as C.

## **Projects**

The following is a list of the projects included in this repository:

### **1. Island Perimeter**

- **Description**: The perimeter of an island described in a grid is calculated, where land cells are represented by `1`and water cells by `0`.
- **Goal**: An algorithm is implemented to compute the perimeter of an island by iterating through the grid and considering the boundaries of the land.
- **Files**: `0-island_perimeter.py`, `0-main.py`, `README.md`

### **2. Lockboxes**

- **Description**: It is determined whether all boxes in a list can be opened using the keys available in each box.
- **Goal**: An algorithm is implemented to check if all boxes can be unlocked starting from the first one, using keys found in each box.
- **Files**: `0-lockboxes.py`, `0-main.py`, `README.md`

### **3. Sandpiles**

- **Description**: The sandpile model is implemented to simulate _self-organized criticality_, where sand grains are added to a 3x3 grid and trigger _topplings_ when certain thresholds are exceeded.
- **Goal**: Sand is added to the grid, toppling rules are applied, and the grid is stabilized.
- **Files**: `sandpiles.h`, `0-sandpiles.c`, `0-main.c`, `README.md`

### **4. Slide Line**

- **Description**: A function is implemented to "slide and merge" an array of integers, similar to the game 2048. The function moves numbers either left or right, merging adjacent equal values while maintaining the correct order.
- **Goal**: An algorithm is implemented to slide numbers in an array based on a specified direction and merge adjacent equal numbers.
- **Files**: `slide_line.h`, `0-slide_line.c`, `0-main.c`, `README.md`

## **Conclusion**

This repository is a collection of projects developed for the _Interview Preparation - Algorithms_ curriculum at Holberton School. The primary objective is to build strong algorithmic problem-solving skills while preparing for technical interviews. These projects reflect an ongoing effort to deepen the understanding of essential algorithms and data structures, ultimately contributing to becoming a more effective problem solver.
