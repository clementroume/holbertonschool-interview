# **Interview Preparation - Algorithms - Holberton School**

## **Introduction**

This repository contains several projects developed as part of the _Interview Preparation - Algorithms_ curriculum at Holberton School, undertaken alongside a Full-Stack development track. The primary goal of these projects is to enhance skills in algorithmic problem-solving, preparing for technical interviews and industry challenges.

Each project focuses on fundamental algorithm concepts, ranging from data manipulation (such as arrays and grids) to the management of more complex structures. These projects aim to test and improve logical reasoning and performance optimization skills using programming languages like C and Python.

## **Projects**

The following is a list of the projects included in this repository, sorted alphabetically:

### **1. Heap Extract**

- **Description**: Implements a function that extracts the root node (the maximum value) of a Max Binary Heap. The operation reorganizes the heap to maintain its properties after extraction.
- **Goal**: To implement a function that removes the largest element from a Max Binary Heap and then rebalances the heap to preserve its structure.

### **2. Island Perimeter**

- **Description**: Calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid, where land cells are represented by `1` and water cells by `0`. The algorithm iterates through the grid and counts the boundaries of the land.
- **Goal**: To write an algorithm that computes the perimeter of a single island within a grid by analyzing adjacent cells.

### **3. Linked List Palindrome**

- **Description**: Implements an efficient algorithm to determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome by reversing its first half and comparing it with the second.

- **Goal**: To check if a singly linked list is a palindrome efficiently, ideally with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.

### **4. Lockboxes**

- **Description**: Determines whether all boxes in a list can be opened using the keys available in each box, starting from the first one.
- **Goal**: To create a method that determines if a series of locked boxes can all be opened based on a set of keys found within them.

### **5. Making Change**

- **Description**: Solves the **change-making** problem by determining the minimum number of coins needed to make a specific total amount, using a **dynamic programming** approach.
- **Goal**: To find the fewest number of coins required to meet a given total amount from a list of coin denominations.

### **6. Minimum Operations**

- **Description**: Calculates the minimum number of operations (**Copy All** and **Paste**) needed to produce exactly `n`characters `H` in a text file. The solution is based on the **prime factorization** of `n`.

- **Goal**: To devise an algorithm that finds the minimum number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations to achieve a target number of characters.

### **7. Radix Sort**

- **Description**: Implements the **Radix Sort** algorithm, **LSD (Least Significant Digit)** variant, to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
- **Goal**: To implement the Radix Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers by processing individual digits.

### **8. Rain**

- **Description**: Solves the "trapping rain water" problem. Calculates the total volume of water that can be retained between walls of varying heights represented by a list of integers.
- **Goal**: To calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between a series of bars of different heights after a rainfall.

### **9. Sandpiles**

- **Description**: Implements the **sandpile model** to simulate **self-organized criticality**. A sandpile is a 3x3 grid where cells with more than 3 grains "topple," distributing grains to neighbors until the grid is stable. The main function adds two sandpiles and stabilizes the result.
- **Goal**: To implement a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles and stabilizes the result according to the toppling rules of the Abelian sandpile model.

### **10. Slide Line**

- **Description**: Implements a function to "slide and merge" an array of integers, similar to the game 2048. The function moves numbers either left or right, merging adjacent equal values.
- **Goal**: To implement an algorithm that slides and merges numbers in an array in a specified direction (left or right), similar to the mechanics of the game 2048.

### **11. UTF-8 Validation**

- **Description**: Implements a function that determines if a given sequence of integers (representing bytes) is a valid **UTF-8** encoding by adhering to its formatting rules.

- **Goal**: To validate whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoded character sequence.

### **12. Wild Compare**

- **Description**: Implements a **recursive** function (without loops) that compares two strings, where the second string can contain the wildcard character `*`, which can match any sequence of characters.
- **Goal**: To compare two strings for equality, where one string may contain a wildcard `*` that can match any substring (including an empty one).

## **Conclusion**

This repository is a collection of projects developed for the _Interview Preparation - Algorithms_ curriculum at Holberton School. The primary objective is to build strong algorithmic problem-solving skills while preparing for technical interviews. These projects reflect an ongoing effort to deepen the understanding of essential algorithms and data structures, ultimately contributing to becoming a more effective problem solver.
